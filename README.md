# Procedural Terrain Generation based on Perlin Noise algorithm.

Procedural generation is an algorithmic technique that dynamically creates content, offering endless possibilities for generating complex and realistic terrains in a variety of applications, including games, simulations, and visualizations.
<br><br>
What is Procedural Generation?
<br>
Procedural generation involves using algorithms to generate content algorithmically, rather than manually designing every detail. In the context of terrain generation, this means creating landscapes, mountains, and valleys on the fly, providing a dynamic and ever-changing environment. Procedural generation is a powerful tool for developers seeking to add variety and unpredictability to their virtual worlds.
